          Planning and Analysis This first phase entails gathering
          requirements, defining the scope of the project, performing market
          research and developing a thorough project plan. It comprises
          determining the app's goals, target audience, and important
          capabilities.

          Design & Development When the planning is finished, the design
          process begins. This involves UI/UX design, prototyping and developing
          wireframes. Development is the process of actually creating the
          software, integrating features, and assuring compatibility across
          various devices and platforms.

          Testing and deployment. In this final phase, comprehensive
          testing is carried out to detect and resolve any faults or issues.
          This comprises functional and usability testing, performance testing,
          and security testing. Once testing is completed and the app fulfills
          quality standards, it is released to the appropriate app stores for
          customers to download and install.
